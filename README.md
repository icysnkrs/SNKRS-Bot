5. Browser Delay:
- delay between browser start (ex: 15000 = 15 sec) (first browser will start, after 15 sec will start other one ...)
- recomandation for this is (30000-45000) depends on your specs.

6. Save account sessions? (Y/N):
- when you run for the first time set it to "Y" and after you save the account session you can only run "N".
- after getting the sessions for accounts it will be faster to get to entry point and also more "legit".

7. Use proxies? (Y/N):
- up to you if you want to use proxies or run locally.
- if you set it to Y, it will display how many proxies you loaded in nike_info/proxies.txt
