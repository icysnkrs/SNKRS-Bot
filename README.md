Welcome to IcySNKRS BOT!

⭐ First steps:

1. Start it with your IDE (VS,Jetbrains etc.)
2. You have to add a region, available for now only XP/SEA (Ex: AU/CA/RO/SG/PH/VN etc.).
3. Add product SKU.
4. Sizes:
- add ONLY US sizes format!!
- as many sizes you add as many browsers will open.
- every browser will be with specific acc,card,proxy(if you add)
5. Browser Delay:
- delay between browsers (ex: 15000 = 15 sec) (first browser will start, after 15 sec will start another one ...)
- delay recommendation (30000-45000) depends on your specs.
6. Save account sessions? (Y/N):
- when you run the bot for the first time set it to "Y" otherwise you will get an error or crash. After you save the account session you can only run "N".
- after getting the sessions for accounts it will be faster to get to entry point.
7. Use proxies? (Y/N):
- up to you if you want to use proxies or run locally.
- if you set it to Y, it will display how many proxies you loaded in nike_info/proxies.txt
8. It will start the browsers :D
